                    <p>Sometimes entitled as “The Freezing Moon,” “Freezing Moon” is Mayhem’s most popular song, having been covered by bands such as Vader, Cradle of Filth and Behemoth. It was also included on Kerrang!’s list of 25 Extreme Metal Anthems.
                        Along with three other songs on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas (“Funeral Fog,” “Buried by Time and Dust” and “Pagan Fears”), the lyrics were written by Dead between 1987 and 1989.</p>

                <p>Bassist Necrobutcher claims to have written it with Dead, with Euronymous penning only one riff. Along with a re-recording of “Carnage,” it was recorded and released as a demo in the April of 1990 and later released in 1991 on the CBR Records compilation Projections Of A Stained Mind. These two demos are the only known studio recordings with Dead on lead vocals before he committed suicide one year later. Later, these recordings were reissued twice, once by Black Metal Records in 1996 as a picture disc single, and later in 2002 by Supernal Music as part of a split EP with The Meads of Asphodel, an experimental black metal band.</p>
